### A user story for the sampling app

A researcher wants to have an app for storing their research samples in order to access all their data in one place.
They go to samplingapp.herokuapp.com to start.

They click "View all sampling sites" in order to see all the sites already in the database.

They read through the list of sampling sites on the page but their own sampling site is not on the list.

They write the name of their new sampling site into the box below the list and click "Add."

They made a typo and want to rename their sampling site. 
They do this by writing a new name in the box between the "Delete" and "Rename" buttons and by clicking "Rename."

They notice that on the list there is an old sampling site that's no longer relevant. 
They delete this sampling site by clicking the button "Delete" next to the name of that sampling site.
